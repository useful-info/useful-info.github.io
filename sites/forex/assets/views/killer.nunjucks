          <h1>Forex Killer software</h1>
          <p>Trading the foreign exchange currency market has become a popular pursuit for many market traders. As a result, a multitude of commercial products have surfaced to fill the information gap about how to use this trading market profitably. One of these tools is the trading software known as Forex Killer promoted by Andreas Kerchberger. The software works by providing a signal designed to catch the trading trend.</p>
          <p>The only catch is that you have to know what you are doing in order to allow the software to help you make a profit. If you are inexperienced in forex trading, then don't fall into the false assumption that all you have to do is listen to what the Forex Killer software recommends and follow its advice. It's just as easy to back into a bad trade as it is to find a good one. Having a solid foundation in forex trading will help you to be cautious when using any kind of mechanized system.</p>

          <p>While Forex Killer is often successful in finding a trend, it can sometimes give signals too late for the trader to comfortably make a decent profit. This is where a person's trading experience comes in handy, in being able to spot a trend close enough to its beginning to be able to take advantage of the ride. This is why some people are not particularly impressed with this software. It doesn't tell them anything more than what their knowledge of the charts and so forth have already disclosed.</p>
          <p>This means that once the trend has been identified and the trade made, the person should be knowledgeable enough to be able to check the charts for any major levels of support or resistance which the trade may encounter during it's continuation. Without being able to make these critical determinations regarding the support and resistance of price levels, a person could quickly find themselves in a losing position.</p>
          <p>So, if you're a beginning currency trader in particular, don't fall into the trap of thinking that the software is going to be able to save your investment by always giving you timely information that will allow you to exit a profitable trade in time to preserve its profit. You may on occasion have to rely on other resources (in particular, past trading experience) to give you a heads up.</p>
